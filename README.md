# About

I began coding at 11 and landed my first job in the second semester of college after winning a regional
contest. In the last few years, my focus has been on designing and implementing Infrastructure as Code
using AWS CDK.

On 2014, I developed a PC tool for League of Legends players that had more than 15.000 downloads.

On 2016, while waiting 6 months to start my graduation, a cousin showed me the ultimate way to learn and practice programming languages and algorithms: online judgers, particularly URI Online Judge. Since then, I never stopped practicing.

On 2018 I created a FPGA board simulator that drastically changed the COA classes at my college. Before, students had to request permission to practice with the physical boards. Additionally, the simulator reduced code build time from over 3 minutes to 7 seconds, facilitating incremental code modifications during tests.

On 2020 I created a coronavirus-themed game that was downloaded by more than 70.000 people around the world, with a conversion rate of 15%!
